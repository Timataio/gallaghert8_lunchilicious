# gallaghert8_lunchilicious
CMPS 355 Final Project

Lunchilicious is a mobile app which lets users view an eatery's menu and make orders based on that menu. The contents of the menu and orders are stored using the Room Database which can be stored remotely. The app also uses other common Android abstractions like a WorkManager to keep the database updated and fragments to control different frontend screens. The code provided does not have logins for the databases or the maven build files, and as a result, it will not work out of the box.
